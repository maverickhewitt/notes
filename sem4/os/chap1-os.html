<h2>3. What is an Operating System?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>An operating system (OS) is a program that acts as an intermediary between users and computer hardware.</li>
    <li>Goals of an Operating System:
        <ul>
            <li>Execute user programs and make solving user problems easier.</li>
            <li>Make the computer system convenient to use.</li>
            <li>Use the computer hardware efficiently.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Computer System Structure</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A computer system can be divided into four components:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Provides basic computing resources (CPU, memory, I/O devices).</li>
            <li><strong>Operating System:</strong> Controls and coordinates the use of hardware among various applications and users.</li>
            <li><strong>Application Programs:</strong> Define how system resources are used to solve computing problems (e.g., word processors, compilers).</li>
            <li><strong>Users:</strong> People, machines, or other computers that interact with the system.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Operating System Definition</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The OS serves as a resource allocator, managing all resources and deciding between conflicting requests for efficient and fair resource use.</li>
    <li>It acts as a control program, controlling the execution of programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer.</li>
    <li>The kernel is the core component of the OS that runs at all times, while other components are either system programs or application programs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Computer System Organization</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Computer system operation involves:
        <ul>
            <li>One or more CPUs and device controllers connected through a common bus providing access to shared memory.</li>
            <li>Concurrent execution of CPUs and devices competing for memory cycles.</li>
            <li>Device drivers for each device controller to manage I/O operations.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Interrupt Handling</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Interrupts signal events that require attention from the CPU, allowing the OS to respond to asynchronous events.</li>
    <li>Types of interrupts:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hardware Interrupts:</strong> Generated by hardware devices (e.g., I/O devices) to signal that they require processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Software Interrupts:</strong> Generated by programs (traps) due to errors (e.g., division by zero) or requests for OS services.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Interrupt handling involves:
        <ul>
            <li>Saving the state of the CPU and determining the appropriate interrupt service routine to execute.</li>
            <li>Restoring the CPU state after the interrupt has been handled.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Process Management</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A process is a program in execution, requiring resources such as CPU, memory, and I/O.</li>
    <li>Key Concepts:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Process Lifecycle:</strong> Stages include New, Ready, Running, Waiting, and Terminated.</li>
            <li><strong>Single-threaded vs Multi-threaded:</strong> Single-threaded processes have one program counter, while multi-threaded processes have multiple counters for each thread.</li>
            <li><strong>Context Switching:</strong> The process of storing the state of a process so that it can be resumed later.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Activities include:
        <ul>
            <li>Creating and deleting both user and system processes.</li>
            <li>Suspending and resuming processes based on resource availability.</li>
            <li>Providing mechanisms for process synchronization (e.g., semaphores, mutexes).</li>
            <li>Providing mechanisms for inter-process communication (IPC) such as message passing and shared memory.</li>
            <li>Handling deadlocks through prevention, avoidance, detection, and recovery strategies.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Memory Management</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Memory management determines what is in memory to optimize CPU utilization and response time.</li>
    <li>Activities include:
        <ul>
            <li>Keeping track of which parts of memory are currently being used and by whom.</li>
            <li>Deciding which processes (or parts thereof) and data to move into and out of memory.</li>
            <li>Allocating and deallocating memory space as needed.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>10. Storage Management</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The OS provides a uniform, logical view of information storage, abstracting physical properties to logical storage units (files).</li>
    <li>Activities include:
        <ul>
            <li>Creating and deleting files and directories.</li>
            <li>Providing primitives to manipulate files and directories.</li>
            <li>Mapping files onto secondary storage.</li>
            <li>Backing up files onto stable (non-volatile) storage media.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>11. Protection and Security</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Protection mechanisms control access of processes or users to resources defined by the OS.</li>
    <li>Security involves defending the system against internal and external attacks, including:
        <ul>
            <li>Denial-of-service attacks</li>
            <li>Worms and viruses</li>
            <li>Identity theft</li>
            <li>Theft of service</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Systems distinguish among users to determine who can do what, using user IDs and group IDs for access control.</li>
</ul>

<h2>12. Computing Environments</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Types of computing environments include:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Traditional:</strong> Stand-alone general-purpose machines.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile:</strong> Handheld devices like smartphones and tablets.</li>
            <li><strong>Distributed:</strong> Systems networked together, providing a unified interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Client-Server:</strong> Systems where clients request services from centralized servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Peer-to-Peer:</strong> Systems where all nodes act as both clients and servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Virtualization:</strong> Running multiple OSes on a single hardware platform.</li>
            <li><strong>Cloud Computing:</strong> Delivering computing resources as a service over the Internet.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>13. Open-Source Operating Systems</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Open-source operating systems are made available in source-code format, promoting user freedom and collaboration.</li>
    <li>Examples include:
        <ul>
            <li>GNU/Linux</li>
            <li>BSD UNIX (including core of Mac OS X)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Open-source software counters the copy protection and Digital Rights Management (DRM) movement.</li>
</ul>
