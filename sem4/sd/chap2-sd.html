    <h2>4.1 SDLC Methodology</h2>
    <p>A methodology is a formalized approach to implementing the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Various methodologies include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Waterfall Development:</strong> A linear sequential model where each phase must be completed before the next begins.</li>
        <li><strong>Parallel Development:</strong> Multiple phases are developed simultaneously to save time.</li>
        <li><strong>V-Model:</strong> An extension of the waterfall model that emphasizes verification and validation at each stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Rapid Application Development (RAD):</strong> Focuses on rapid prototyping and user feedback.</li>
        <li><strong>Iterative Development:</strong> Development is done in small, iterative cycles, allowing for adjustments based on feedback.</li>
        <li><strong>System Prototyping:</strong> Creating prototypes to visualize and test system functionality early in the development process.</li>
        <li><strong>Throwaway Prototyping:</strong> Building a prototype to understand requirements, which is discarded after use.</li>
        <li><strong>Agile Development:</strong> An iterative approach that promotes flexible responses to change and customer collaboration.</li>
        <li><strong>Object-Oriented Development:</strong> Focuses on using objects to represent data and methods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.1.4 Rapid Application Development (RAD)</h3>
    <p>RAD is a collection of methodologies aimed at fast system development. Key features include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Incorporation of special techniques and computer tools to speed up phases.</li>
        <li>Delivery of portions of the system to users for evaluation and feedback.</li>
        <li>Use of CASE (Computer-Aided Software Engineering) tools, JAD (Joint Application Development) sessions, and fourth-generation programming languages (e.g., Visual Basic.NET).</li>
        <li>Increased user expectations can lead to scope creep or feature creep.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Agile Development</h3>
    <p>Agile methodologies emphasize flexibility and customer collaboration. Key principles include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Continuous testing.</li>
        <li>Simple coding performed by pairs of developers.</li>
        <li>Close interactions with end users to build systems quickly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>SCRUM Methodology</h4>
    <p>SCRUM is a high-intensity teamwork methodology characterized by:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Product Backlog:</strong> A prioritized list derived from product specifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Sprint Backlog:</strong> A dynamic list of tasks to be completed in the next sprint.</li>
        <li><strong>Sprint:</strong> A 30-day period where the development team transforms the backlog into demonstrable software.</li>
        <li><strong>Daily Scrum:</strong> A brief meeting for team members to discuss progress, obstacles, and plans.</li>
        <li><strong>Demo:</strong> Working software that can be demonstrated to the customer.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>4.1.6 Object-Oriented Systems Analysis and Design</h3>
    <p>Object-oriented analysis combines data and processes into objects, facilitating rapid system changes. Key points include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Systems can be added gradually, one subsystem at a time.</li>
        <li>Reuse of previously written software is possible.</li>
        <li>Unified Modeling Language (UML) is the industry standard for modeling object-oriented systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4.3 System Requirements Checklist</h2>
    <p>System requirements are characteristics or features that must be included in an information system. Categories include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Inputs:</strong> Examples include data entry requirements and uniformity of input forms.</li>

    <h2>4.4 Requirements Gathering (Fact Finding Activity)</h2>
    <p>Requirements gathering involves various techniques such as interviews, document reviews, observations, and surveys. It answers six key questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Who?</li>
        <li>What?</li>
        <li>Where?</li>
        <li>When?</li>

        <li>Why?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Process of Determining Requirements</h2>
    <p>Effective requirement determination requires collaboration between business and IT perspectives. Analysts must consider how to elicit requirements from stakeholders, with the understanding that this process evolves throughout the analysis phase.</p>
